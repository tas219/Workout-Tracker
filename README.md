# WorkoutTracker

Tasya and Jessica are making a workout tracker app!

The app allows you to record your workouts by creating a new workout instance, and adding exercises to it. The exercise instances will be able to record weight used, reps done which is interchangable with time, and sets done. For example; ("Benchpress", 90lbs, 10 Reps, 3 Sets,) or ("Plank", (0lbs), 1:30 Min, 3 Sets).

Additional features that may be implemented are:

- Timer to time timed exercises in app
- Calendar view to easily see how consistently you work out
- Tags to tag workouts such as "Legs", "Pull", "Cardio", ect
